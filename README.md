# Chesso â™›

An LLM-driven web app for teaching Chess.

LLMs, as language models, are not great at playing chess. They have no ability to think logically or truly understand the rules of Chess. However, can they teach it? This project aims to develop a tool that combines an LLM with the stockfish chess engine and other chess resources like opening books to see if it can effectively teach someone chess.
